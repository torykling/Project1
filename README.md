# Tory Project 1

## Goal: The goal of this project was to create a static site that visually matched a found mock-up as closely as possible.

This mock-up I found on dribbble.com and was created by Maria Shanina. It can be found at this link: https://dribbble.com/shots/7236854-Success-story.

Additionally, I added media queries to make the design responsive. Since the original mock-up did not include a display for different screen sizes, I tweaked the layout myself to make it more legible on smaller screens. In the mobile version of the site, I made most of the photos and paragraphs full screen and increased the font size. 

I also added hover classes to add interactivity to items in the nav bar, buttons, and the next story line of the footer.

### Challenges:
Originally, I created a wireframe based on the pdf of the original mock-up. But when I wrote up my html and tried to use CSS grid and flexbox to plan the layout, I couldn't get the layout to look the way I wanted it to. 
My teacher Erin suggested I redesign my wireframe and split the site into smaller horizontal divs. After using these smaller divs, I was able to use flexbox to place items in the desired location. 

Another challenge was to make sure the images looked good at different sizes. Chrome devtools helped me test out different image sizes to see what looked good. I was happy with the way the site looked on many of the devtools screen sizes (full screen, iPhone6, etc). However when resizing the browser to intermediate sizes, the photos were sometimes cropped awkwardly. I might need to go back to add more media queries and break down the different screen sizes further. Or maybe I could fix this by experimenting with different image size units, such as viewheight.
